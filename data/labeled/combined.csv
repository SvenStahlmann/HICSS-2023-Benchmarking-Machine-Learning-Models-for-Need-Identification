Everything that it’s doing for me I could do it with my iPhone iPod it so I can listen to music and I can’t even listen to music and I can’t even download it on my computer which I’ve been trying to do for days so it’s been a total waste of money,0,Electronics

Looks and feels great.,0,Electronics
They work good by themselves in bathrooms.,0,Electronics
Very user friendly!!!!,0,Electronics
Got this one for $15 during the Anniversary sale.,0,Electronics
I never seem to remember my shopping list when I leave home so now my list is on my phone after Alexa handling the list.,1,Electronics

So happy.,0,Electronics

I was in love.,0,Electronics
Ok I bought one to give it a try...,0,Electronics
Although it would be nice to have a voice that feels more authentic and maybe even ethnic.,1,Electronics

I bought my first Dot not long after I bought my first Echo Alexa.,0,Electronics
It kinda became my alarm though and I don't really have many uses for it but to turn on/off my lights in the bedroom.,1,Electronics
But all and all very good.,0,Electronics
It answers random questions you might have while eating ;walking around house etc.,0,Electronics
It’s not even after extended or loud use so that is quiet agitating.,0,Electronics
The Dot was the perfect addition to my home.,0,Electronics
"There are major software  glitches every single day: from repeated volume control reduction to the lowest setting (without command) to music playback suddenly stopping or skipping songs in the middle of them, the subwoofer cutting out and/or one or two random speakers dropping off the “multi-room” playback function.",1,Electronics
Too often she has no answer to questions.,1,Electronics
I have both Google Home and Alexa at home.,0,Electronics

Alexa technology is great as well all know who have seen one.,0,Electronics
I'm still learning all of Alexa's skill's.,0,Electronics
So the speaker quality is much greater than the original but other than that and the design there's not very much that is different than the original.,0,Electronics
The drop in am calling feature doesn’t work that great.,0,Electronics
I also have an Echo Dot connected to my stereo system for more critical listening.,0,Electronics

"For some reason, I thought that it would be so hard to use, complicated, etc... but I couldn't have been more wrong!",1,Electronics
It has a great range as I can ask for her while I'm in the kitchen and the Echo Gen 3 is way on the other side of the house in the living room.,1,Electronics
I have two larger ones and three smaller ones so it's hard not to compare.,0,Electronics
I asked Alexa what time a business opened the following day and I was given the response of what time it closed on the present day.,1,Electronics
I don’t know much yet about what the echo dot can do.,0,Electronics
I bought this echo to use on my patio to listen to music or kpods.,1,Electronics
which she could install for $385.00.,0,Electronics
"I know it will not turn it on, but what will it do?",0,Electronics
It’s impressively responsive and the range from which it can hear and respond to my voice is surprising as well.,1,Electronics
"Can’t always hear, sometimes it’s choppy and this is the a feature I REALLY wanted.",1,Electronics
"But really, there are lots of things this is good for that you haven’t thought about.",0,Electronics
"However when it comes to individual tasks like asking Alexa to play a certain playlist on Spotify, she will say she can’t find it.",1,Electronics
"I am sure there are many more things Alexa can  do that I have not hit on yet, but when in doubt if she can do something I give it a try.",0,Electronics
"So, long story short, Im using the Echo for its general uses, not for a Firetv connection.",0,Electronics
A legally blind friend is able to get anything we can get on a computer just by talking.,1,Electronics

Great product for personal use or as a gift.,0,Electronics
"LOVE BOTH ECHO DOT'S, AND TONY AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",0,Electronics

No big difference noted except it has a cloth textured exterior.,0,Electronics
There is also an app that plays iheart radio while I'm gone and keeps background noise for my dog.,0,Electronics
"Paranoia aside, it's pretty handy.",0,Electronics
It doesn't pick up my voice commands all the time.,1,Electronics
Been using for about three months.,0,Electronics
Alexa isn’t that special.,0,Electronics
The sound is so much better!,0,Electronics
I bought this product to set up a multi room music system with my current Echo Dots.,1,Electronics
"It’s good for weather updates, to set alarms, reminders and for shopping lists.",1,Electronics
The Dot worked fine but what I didn't know was that by adding this to my Prime account it charged me an additional $3.99.,1,Electronics
"However, upon first setting this up, it sounds like the speaker is blown.",0,Electronics
Much better than buying in store.,0,Electronics
It’s fine for all the basic Alexa functions.,0,Electronics
Recognizes your from a far off distance as well.,1,Electronics

Love every  thing about The Echo Dot third generation..,0,Electronics
Everything else I'd rather just go through my Google home that I had before.,0,Electronics
It sounds hollow no matter how I adjust it.,1,Electronics
My main one has the ability to hook up with the second one I have on my patio.,0,Electronics
"I purchased this for my parents, who are actually very smart and capable of operating technology; however, this product was not what we expected-It was impossible to set up.",1,Electronics
"It could also work my Vizio smart TV, but I decided against it, because the 4K Fire Sticks apps movies & shows look phenomenally better than the smart apps.",0,Electronics
Bought 2 additional dots to fill in the rest of our rooms.,0,Electronics
Love it!,0,Electronics
I absolutely love these!,0,Electronics
This makes no sense to me and should be changed.,0,Electronics

Set up so easy and I am not a tech person.,1,Electronics
"The old one would say, ""Got it"", or ""That will help me play more of the good stuff.""",0,Electronics

"She tells me the weather, news, plays any song I want (hook her up with spotify), and can find recipes or meal ideas.",1,Electronics
The only draw back the cube plug is big so I had to find a plug that was by itself because I had Alexa enable plug adaptors  to control my lamps it didn’t fit one the same wall outlet because the bulky square plug,1,Electronics
I got a great deal on a three pack of these so I now have them in every room and I’m very happy to have an Alexa in every room of my house even though the Alexa is supposed to be listening to everything you say I don’t really mind too much and it’s a nice thing to have around when you wanna ask a question a player audio game next song quiz even though song quiz tends to get wrong some of your answers and make you lose when you have a good long winning streak it’s still a fun thing to do sometimes I do enjoy having Alexa and all the different rooms of the house and having it locked the door for you or unlock the door for you are setting a timer and various other things so it’s kind of fun to have and I enjoy the little dots even though the big longer one is louder,1,Electronics

We looked around awhile before purchasing a forward facing car seat for our son....after buying a much more expensive rear facing one when he was smaller...This car seat is easy to use and fits him well with plenty room for growth.....we actually went back on line and purchased 2 more...so now we have 3 as we have 2 other babies still rear facing and for now never have to move his carseat as we have 3 vehicles....as the need arises will certainly purchase additional tribute 5 Saturn car seats...,1,Baby

"Car seat arrives mostly assembled, except for the cup holders.",0,Baby
This is well made and is going to do a great job protecting my brand new leather seats.,0,Baby
It had to recline to use the extended legroom.,0,Baby

My grandkids rear face until 3 or 4 and with the leg extender they dont have to sit like a pretzel!,0,Baby

great car seat.,0,Baby
It was getting to be a hassle having to get a car seat dropped off each time we were going somewhere.,0,Baby
Additionally I did not notice when ordering that this seat doesn't have LATCH system.,0,Baby
Straps loosen and tighten conveniently.,1,Baby
"This car seat isn't anything fancy, but looks or lots of extra features aren't a necessity for the budget-minded individual.",0,Baby
We tried taking one of the pads out but it didn't help.,0,Baby
My son fits comfortably and safely.,0,Baby
The cover was super easy to install and is lightweight but protects the seats under the car seat when it's strapped in tight.,1,Baby
"That ones fantastic as well, but I needed a cheaper backup car seat for my boyfriends car, and strapping my son in is so much easier with this carseat!",0,Baby
I like that my daughter can finally look out of the window.,0,Baby
It shifts so easily that I find it annoying.,1,Baby
"Got this seat for $92 and change for black Friday, cheapest I've ever seen one.",0,Baby
These are large enough to protect seats against the largest child car seats.,0,Baby
It's okay.,0,Baby
We bought this recently when it was on sale because our smaller car seat will soon need retiring.,0,Baby
Great seat,0,Baby
We just put the All-In-One in my husband's truck that we use less often when transporting our babe.,0,Baby
"The only tricky part is figuring out how to assemble the first time - trick is to basically fold it flat / backwards to engage the hinge, then you're golden.",0,Baby
It is so lightweight and easy to install.,1,Baby
Great product!,0,Baby
It's the black and white striped one and she loves it!,0,Baby
Love this car seat,0,Baby
"Love this car seat, very easy to install and it allows our son to sit rear facing longer which is much safer in the event of a crash.",1,Baby
Was a cinch to install in both our airline seats as well as our rental car.,1,Baby
my son seems really comfortable in it and has plenty of room to grow.,0,Baby
Highly recommend!,0,Baby
My son loves his two cupholders.,1,Baby
Very lightweight.,1,Baby
I bought this seat specifically from Amazon because I wanted to be sure it was new.,0,Baby
Would purchase this one over that one if I need to buy another.,0,Baby
Bought this for my daughter... she’s now 15 months and we can still use it .... unlike the previous one I bought her that she grew out of... the best part about this item the fact that you can remove the seat cushion and was it.,1,Baby
This car seat is simple enough that our grandchild can tend to it herself without getting pinched with all the usual latches found in most car seats.,0,Baby
"The only thing is that it is a little hard, but I guess that is fine.",0,Baby
This does NOT have latch hooks on it FYI.,1,Baby
"Easy install, easy buckling and adjustment.",1,Baby
"Great car seat, has extras that make traveling with toddlers easier!",0,Baby
Very easy to install and move from car to car.,1,Baby
It fits in my car better than the graco4ever and leaves way more leg room in my Subaru impreza wagon,0,Baby
At first I was skeptical because of the light color of the seat and its potential for staining and such.,0,Baby
Ordered this for my 4 year old who was getting a bit too tall for the bulky infant/toddler seat and we also wanted something that took up less space in the car.,0,Baby
"I wouldn't of ordered a white lined car seat, but that's my only complaint.",0,Baby
Easy to install.,1,Baby
Great.,0,Baby
Color isn't what i was expecting.,0,Baby
I couldn’t  be anymore happier for buying this!,0,Baby
I purchased this also because it extends and it holds up to a higher weight and size.,1,Baby
But I needed to replace that.,0,Baby
Our 18 month old is still comfortable riding in it rear-facing (he's 25-50th percentile for height and weight).,0,Baby
We bought this and on the first use our son was transported to a parallel dimension when we stopped too fast.,0,Baby
"The carseat performed as expected but, I was shocked to discover that the seat was stained!",0,Baby
The last thing that is super irritating is the cover.,0,Baby
The car seat was narrow enough that it was comfortable for me to sit next to the baby without being squished.,1,Baby
Might be challenging for a grandparent or someone not familiar with carseats.,0,Baby
Great product,0,Baby
Learn your car.,0,Baby
We frequently switch cars and its been simple to take out and put back in.,0,Baby
Nice,0,Baby
Daughter love it.,0,Baby

The base is also very hard and sharp edges so if you don't put a heavy towel between all places of the seat where it touches it will probably damage your car.,1,Baby
I bought this for my grandson when he grew out of his harness car seat.,0,Baby
It would be great if they offer canopy to have some shade while driving during sunny days.,0,Baby
No more screaming or crying.,0,Baby
Love the two cup holders.,1,Baby
"It's very safe which is most important, but it's also comfortable for our infant.",0,Baby

A real pain to install.,1,Baby
i bought this because we have other graco items that were great!,0,Baby
Don’t know how this passes safety tests.,0,Baby
This one is perfect.,0,Baby
"Not going to be great for long trips, that's for sure, but I haven't tried out using just the bottom portion with the extra strap piece.",0,Baby
We have had the car seat for 1 1/2 weeks.,0,Baby
We've even been on long car rides.,0,Baby
Get some sort of neck support for your baby.,1,Baby
Love this seat.,0,Baby
Received a different colored seat than what I ordered but kept it bc I needed to use the seat right away.,0,Baby
This car seat works great!,0,Baby
My son bought a car seat for over $300 and he hates it.,0,Baby
"Overall, I don't like this seat.",0,Baby
"Easy to assemble and my son loves it, the high back is nice because it avoids the seat belt from rubbing on his neck",1,Baby
Was great when my grandson came to visit for a month!,0,Baby
"But in hindsight, I would recommend it nonetheless.",0,Baby
Was put on hold for 15 minutes.,0,Baby
He can be comfortable and have his upper body supported if he falls asleep but has a big boy seat that is different then his sister's car seat-who is 2 1/2!,0,Baby
Very high quality Car seat at a reasonable price.,0,Baby
My 4 year old outgrew his other carseat and is a big boy so we tried this booster and absolutely fell in lobe with it!,0,Baby
My daughter loves her new car seat.. nice Cush.. hidden cup holders could be deeper..,0,Baby
My wife has a small coupe and we weren't sure if we would be able to find one that could fit.,0,Baby

"If I had known it wasn't, I would not have made the purchase.",0,Baby
"The safety of our Grandson is paramount, and we're pleased.",1,Baby
Also a car seat bucket is way better so you can transport them in the seat without waking them up.,0,Baby
I put two of these in my 8 seater 2011 Toyota Sienna van.,0,Baby
good,0,Baby
I also have a Graco Contender 65 which I thought was a decent car seat...nope!,0,Baby
